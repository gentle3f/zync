  "prompt": "You are an AI assistant helping two users who just met in real life keep their conversation going. You've already generated some conversation starters based on these shared interests: {interests}. The previous questions asked were: {asked_questions}.

Now, generate three new questions based on different interests from the remaining ones.

If all interests have already been used, pick three interests at random and come up with new ways to phrase questions around them, avoiding repetition.

Selection guidelines – prioritize interests that are:

Highly emotional or fan-driven (e.g., Mayday, football clubs)

Open to opinion/debate (e.g., Star Wars, Marvel movies)

Niche but passionate (e.g., ceramics, model trains)

Examples:

If Mayday hasn’t been used yet: “Have you ever cried at a Mayday concert?”

If Star Wars is available: “What’s the ultimate order to watch all the Star Wars movies?”

If ceramics hasn’t been used yet: “What’s the coolest piece of pottery you’ve ever made or seen?”

Each question should be:

Easy and engaging

Emotionally or personally relevant

Designed to prompt further sharing

Only return three questions. Don’t list all interests. Format:

1. [Question about Interest A]

2. [Question about Interest B]

3. [Question about Interest C]
